Welcome to the Getting Started with Python course, the first lesson in our Python for Everyone
specialization. We have built this course specifically for those who have no coding experience.
With a relatively simple book and basic exercises that focus on basic programming concepts, we hope
that you will gain a solid inderstanding of this topics in this course and be well prepared for the rest of the
specialization courses.

We expect that a person who knows another programming language and is just trying to learn Python will
be able to complete the material of this course in 2-3 weeks, while a person who has not done programming will
take 5-6 weeks. Please take your time and learn these concepts well, as without proper preparation, there
is no point in rushing into follow-up sessions.

We keep this first section as a source of material throughout the course so that you can refer back to it
and refer to it as needed throughout the course.

Note: The Open Michigan materials mentioned in the previous video are available on the website - https://www.py4e.com/
