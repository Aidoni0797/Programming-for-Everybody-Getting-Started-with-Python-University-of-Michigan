I'm Guido van Rossum. I created the Python language. I have worked on Python for 25 years and I have worked
with a large group of others of course in the Python community. I'm very excited to see you all in this class.
And I'm very proud that you're using my language to learn. Python is just the first step you're setting on the
path programming. There are many exciting things to learn in programming.

Many that you can learn using Python, many that you can learn using other things. And you won't be alone.
The will be millions of people who have gone before you or, or who are learnong Python at the same time as you. And you,
you can help each other, and you can learn together.
