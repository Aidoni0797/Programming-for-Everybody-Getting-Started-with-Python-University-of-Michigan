Getting involved in the community
We expect everyone to be mindful (внимательный) of what they are saying and its potential impact on others.
The goal is to have respectful discussions that do not disrupt (нарушать) the space of the community
created for these discussions. Here are some productive ways to participate (участвовать) in this course:
Participate: This is a community. Read what others write and share your thoughts.
Stay curious: Learn from experts and from each other by listening and asking questions, not making
assumptions (предположения).
Keep a positive attitude: When replying to a message in a discussion forum, express your thoughts
about what was said, not about who write it. Avoid (избегать) using capital letters, lots of
exclamation points, and aggressive language.
Acknowledge the discomfort: The topics discussed in this course may be challenging or
difficult to discuss. Stick to this and be mindful of the benefits of such difficult conversations 
that are revealed from different perspectives.

We expect (ожидать) all students to adhere (соблюдать) to our full Student engagement policies.
We will ensure that this course does not contain language that could be considered inflammatory
(провокационный), abusive (оскорбительный), racist (расист значит человек, который считает одну расу людей лучше или хуже другой и относится к людям предвзято из-за их происхождения или цвета кожи.)
or otherwise inappropriate (неподходящий) for this learning space, and will remove those that are 
considered (рассматриваемый) as such.

Note regarding "study groups" outside the platform: While students are encouraged (воодушевлённый)
to interact with each other using the communication tools offered within the learning platform,
please note that any study groups created outside of this platform, such as social media or
communication apps and websites (such as WhatsApp), are not affiliated (связанный) with,
maintained, or moderated by the University of Michigan. If you received (полученный) an
