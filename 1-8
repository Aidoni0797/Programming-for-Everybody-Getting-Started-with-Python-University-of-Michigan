Welcome back. Now, we're going to talk a little bit about hardware architecture. You might ask yourself
sort of why all these terms, ans words, and central processing unit, what I want from this section is
I just want to define a few terms, so that I can use them in the rest of the course. That's really it. 
I want you to have some sense of the basic block diagram of things. Now in the old days, I'm going to show
you three generations of hardware. I'm going to show you really old hardware from the 60s and 70s.
I'm going to show you sort of medium old hardware from the 90's and early 2000s. And then, I'm going
to show you sort of suuper brand new hardware that sort of this is a Raspberry Pi and it's the kind
of highly integrated hardware that goes into things like the cellphone. So I'll kind of be going 
back and forth between three complete generations of hardware. But the picture and the concepts that
I want you to understand are these terms. Central processing unit, main memory, secondary memory unit,
and input/output devices. So we'll start with input/output devices. There is a little, that's okay
just mess up a little bit, no problem at all.
Output devices, screens, and that's sort of how the humans in the outside world interact. Software,
the main inside the computer, we have the central processing unit, and the main memory, and then
the secondary memory. And so it's probably easier for  me to take the, neither the oldest nor the
newest, to give you a sense of what is going on here. And so, if you had a desktop and maybe you still
have one of these junky old desktops at home, they are the ones that are big and they make noise when 
they start up, they have in them a number of differrent parts and the closest thing that a computer
has to intelligence in this. Central processing unit, CPU is what we call them. And if you look at
the back side of this CPU it is actually a circuit. It's a highly sphisticated circuit with
millions of transistors on it, and, you've probably heard that, millions of transistors. It runs maybe 
three billion instructions per second.

What does that mean? Well that means that an instructions is a set of electrical pulses, maybe 32 little 
wires or 64 little wires. And at three billion times a second, this is programmed to ask what's
next. And it pulls what's next in these little electric wires. Well,
