Python as a language
[SOUND] So now we're going to talk about Python as a programming language. You probably noticed (заметили) that I'm wearing a sorting hat. The 
reason I'm wearing a sorting hat is that where I work at the University of Michigan School of Information, we are in a building called the North Quad.
And you can look it up on Google and find a picture of it if you like. And I think it's designed to be like Hogwarts. It's got a little center, it's got 
this outside bit, it's got a really cool cafeteria that looks like owls might fly through it. And so we moved to this a few years back when I started 
teaching Python.

And I was teaching my very, very first class in this building, which we've sort of lovingly called Quadwarts, because it's North Quad and we
thought it was kind of like Hogwarts. And so, I'm jiking, and I wore my robes to class, and I said welcome to Quadwarts, and you have to wear 
your robes every time to class, and I was being funny. And I said okay, it's our first class, we're teaching Python, and let's do a sorting
ceremony. I didn't have the sorting hat back then, so O have a sorting hat now. And so, that's cool. And I'm like, I think I'm going to be in Gryffindor.
And they told me, the students said that I couldn't be in Gryffindor.

And I'm like, why can't I be in Gryffindor? Everybody wants to be in Gryffondor. And they told me that I was teaching Python. Python is like a programming
language that's based on a snake. And even worse, my name's Charles Severance, and I'm like Severus snape. And so they basically told me that I had
to be in Slytherin. And so since then, I've bought many Slytherin items, I got Slytherin wands, when I greduate, you'll see my Slytherin wand.
